\textbf{Note on plagiarism} 
\\[2ex]
Since the evaluation of the project report and code will be part of the final grade in the course, \textbf{plagiarism in your project handin will be considered cheating at the exam}. Whenever adopting code or text from elsewhere you must state this and give a reference/link to your source. It is perfectly fine to search information and adopt partial solutions from the internet – actually, this is encouraged – but always state your source in your handin. Also discussing your problems with your project with other students is perfectly fine, but remember each group should handin their own solution. If you are in doubt if you solution will be very similar to another group because you discussed the details, please put a remark that you have discussed your solution with other groups.
